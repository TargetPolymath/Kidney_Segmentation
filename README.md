# Kidney Segmentation
The Kaggle Kidney Segmentation challenge.

This is where I'll be keeping my early developments, notes, and research for the HuBMAP Kidney Challenge on Kaggle.
I won't be uploading anything directly related to completing the challenge.

# Current Topic
Q. Can a convolutional kernel described by an inverse Fourier Transform function, sampled at multiple densities (ie 3x3, 5x5), be used to detect features at multiple different pixel scales?
A. So far, yes! It's not perfect, but it performes as well as similar convolutions which require more bits to express, reducing parameter exchange time between multiple GPUs and final model size. Still early days of testing.
